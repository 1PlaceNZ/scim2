## About the SCIM 2 SDK
  
The UnboundID SCIM 2 SDK for Java provides a powerful and flexible set of APIs for interacting with SCIM service providers and resources. Use it to build applications and servers that interoperate with SCIM servers such as the [UnboundID Data Broker](https://www.unboundid.com/data-broker).

Please refer to the [SCIM 2 SDK README](https://github.com/UnboundID/scim2) for license and support information.
